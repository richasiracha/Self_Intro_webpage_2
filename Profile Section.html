                <p>Hii, my name is Richa. I'm a Computer Science Engineering student at Mar Baselios College of 
                Engineering and Technology at Trivandrum in my First year. 
                 </p>

                <p>This is my first project with HTML and CSS, and I found it super interesting and really
                enjoyable — a really, really welcome change from C programming :).</p>

                <p>I would call myself an extrovert. In an entirely new environment, I'm sort of shy at first,
                but once I find my people, I'm an extrovert through and through. I lived in the UAE till 12th 
                grade and only moved here this year. I'm loving it so far. College life, hostel life — it's all 
                a new chapter and one that I'm really enjoying :)). I've been told, however, that this joy only 
                lasts one year and then reality bites, so I guess I'll just have to enjoy it while it lasts.</p>

                <p>I'm very eager to be an active part of GDGC, and I hope it will be a really positive experience. 
                (It's been a 10/10 club so far :)) )</p>
